Node Helpers
===============

The ``node_helpers`` package consists of various frameworks
and utilities that help make writing ROS code more seamless. There is no
code specific to the Urban Machine robot here, rather, it's intended to be generically
useful for quickly building robust, reliable, and maintainable ROS nodes.

In this documentation, the important modules within ``node_helpers`` will be documented, with some
explanation about their intended use within the larger framework.
